## About Me

I am a recent CS graduate from Duke University working full time as a software engineer. Both within my work and outside, I am passionate about building and maintaining full-stack applications, and managing fully-fledged data pipelines, from database design to analytics and model deployment. I am always seeking to leverage my skills to tackle business problems and deliver quantifiable results.
