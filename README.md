## About Me

I am a current undergraduate student at Duke University studying computer science, statistics, and economics. I am passionate about building fully-fledged data pipelines, from database design to analytics and model deployment. I aim to leverage my skills to tackle business problems and deliver quantifiable results with lasting impacts on business efficiencies.

## Projects

- **[Map Navigation Simulator](https://github.com/Rohilkan/MapNavigator.git)** - utilized graph traversal and shortest path algorithms to determine and display to users ideal highway routes between any two US cities given their coordinates.
- **[Machine Learning COVID-era Stock Prediction](https://github.com/Rohilkan/StockPredictML.git)** - leveraged LSTM recurrent neural networks to predict performance of popular company stock prices in COVID and post-COVID era.
- **[Employee Network Analysis ML Project](https://github.com/Rohilkan/Employee-Network-Analysis-Project.git)** - used various graph types (preferential attachment, small world networks) and node and edge-wise features (centrality, influence measures, connectivity) to model employee network,  imputing missing data with machine learning ensemble models.
